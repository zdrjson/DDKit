Food Related Illnesses
We need to be careful when preparing good, due to foodborne illnesses. These are illnesses from bacteria that contaminate food. Symptoms include vomiting, fever, aches, and may even include diarrhoea. Even if infected food is eliminated from the stomach, germs can pass through into the intestines and begin to multiply, and thus the illness continues. Some types of microbes stay and produce a toxin, or poison, that is absorbed into the blood. This can be serious, especially for the old, the very young or pregnant women.

Tips For Food Safety
Wash cutting boards and knives with hot soapy water, especially after cutting raw meat, poultry or seafood.
Never place food on the same surface that held raw meat, poultry or seafood, unless it has been washed.
Use visual signs to check if food is cooked;
   Pork, veal and poultry are white inside, not pink or red 
   Steam rises from food
   Clear, not pink juices, run from meat and poultry
   Shellfish is opaque, and fish flakes easily when cut
   Egg yolks are firm, not runny, egg whites are opaque
