Don't go Cheap
When participating in a gift exchange at the office, there is typically a dollar limit set for the gifts. Try to stick to that limit and don't buy anything you wouldn't buy or use yourself just because it is cheap. If you wanted to save money, you should have avoided participating in the exchange in the first place. Besides, if you offer a cheap gift, your colleague might think you are participating in the exchange just because you felt obligated and not because you truly appreciate him or her.

Have you ever given a gift because you felt obligated to do so?
