Espresson
Espresso is a strong black coffee made by forcing steam through dark roasted aromatic coffee beans at high pressure in an espresso machine. A perfectly brewed espresso will have a thick, golden-brown crema (foam) on the surface. If the crema is good, the sugar you add will float on the surface for a couple of seconds before slowly sinking to the bottom.

How to have it:
Espresso should be taken either on its own or with a small teaspoon of sugar. Having it "short" means that it has less water and is therefore more concentrated, and "long" conversely uses more water and does not taste as strong.
