Positive Role Models
Parents are often their kid's role models, making it vital that parents display good table manners and a willingness to try new foods. Simply put, kids are much more likely to eat the same foods as their parents and practice the same table manners. A good way to ensure your child doesn't become a picky eater is to making offering them new foods a regular mealtime routine.

Of course they won't like everything you offer them, so teach them to politely refuse things they don't want to try. This is also a great opportunity to remind your children to eat slowly, chew their food well with their mouth closed, and to enjoy their meal. Keep in mind that children often take much longer to eat than adults - so don't rush them!
