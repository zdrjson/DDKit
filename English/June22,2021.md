I've worked in software engineering for my entire 15-year career, and my commitment to critical thinking and attention to detail have gotten me to where I am today: a senior software engineer for First Technology. I have a passion for processes, and I'm an experienced team leader who typically manages 10 developers at any given time.

"Prior to my senior role, I worked as as software engineer for First Technology and a programmer for Mobile First. Because I've already held all the other positions in this field, I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project. My career goal is to move into management as a CTO, and I know this role would help me hone my leadership skills."
