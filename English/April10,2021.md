Questions
Do you consider yourself to be a trendy person? If so, in what ways?

Are you a fan of retro fashion? What are some examples of retro fashion?

Introduction
The word 'retro' implies a style that reminiscent of the past. Retro can be used to describe things that actually come from a past time period or things that are new, but designed in a way that is suggestive of a past style.
As an example, since rollerblades became popular in the 90s, few people bother with traditional roller skates anymore. So, if you saw someone skating down the street on roller skates, you could say, "Wow, roller skates, How retro"
