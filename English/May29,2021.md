Introduction
Many people enjoy the health and relaxation benefits of running. A five-or ten-kilometer run through a park on a beautiful fall day can burn off all those calories of a decadent dessert and lift the spirits after a grueling day at work. Some runners, however, feel compelled to run longer distances. This year, nearly half a million people will complete a marathon! Many will run for their health or for the challenge; however, a handful will run in hopes of breaking a record.
