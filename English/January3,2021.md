Gardens And Gardening

The Asian way of gardening is very different from the European way. This difference is also reflected in art. Asian gardeners always wanted to approach nature as organically as possible until the ultimate unification with the natural world could be achieved. While Europeans admire nature's beauty, the goal is to reshape the natural world. The European idea of gardening has changed fundamentally across the centuries, paving the way for landscape gardens. The passion for gardening can build way for landscape gardens. The passion for gardening can build bridges between different people and different cultures.
