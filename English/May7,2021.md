Effect on Body
Studies have shown that being deprived of sleep for too long will decrease the total amount of white blood cells in the human body, which will make people more vulnerable to sickness. Another effect that sleep has over the human body is weight. When a person's sleep cycle is interrupted, so is one's metabolism level, causing a person's weight to fluctuate.
