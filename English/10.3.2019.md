Missing Nonrestrictive Commas
A modifying word, phrase, or clause following a noun is set off by commas if it presents information which is not essential to identify the noun or the meaning of the sentence.

Practice putting the comma at the right place in the following sentences.

1. My daughter, who is holding a bouquetï¼Œis already three years old.
2. Eric, who is my boss, lives in Taipei.
3. The Bugatti Veyron, the most expensive production car in the world, has 1001 brake horse power.

Unnecessary Commas
In many cases, the comma is being abused excessively. One of the most common mistakes using the comma is putting a comma between subjects and verbs, often after restrictive elements.
