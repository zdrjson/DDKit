Why do it?

With so many disadvantages, why would anyone want to move into management? Lower management is tough, but it can be very rewarding. Happy managers are usually people who love to coach others. They enjoy developing their employees and get satisfaction from watching them grow.

Money

Moving up into your first management job usually means a big increase in pay - but, if money is the only reason you want the job, you will probably be disappointed. However, becoming a manager does create a very large number of development opportunities for you.
