Grammar: Verbs of perception + object + infinitive/-ing
We use an -ing clause with an object after these verbs:
see, hear, watch, notice, observe, smell, listen, find, feel, look at, to talk about something that happened over a period of time in the past.

Example:
She lay in bed, listening to the rain falling.
The children looked at the monkeys playing in the zoo.

Grammar: Verbs of perception + object + infinitive/-ing
2) We use the infinitive without "to" but with an object and these verbs of perception: see, hear, watch, notice, observe, smell, listen to, feel to describe actions that have been completed.
Example:
I saw him park the car, open the door, get out and cross the road. (I saw the start and finish of each activity.)
The audience listened to the group play their latest hits. (They heard the whole show.)
She watched them steal the car, and then she phoned the police. (She saw everything.)
