Fun For Kids
The fair provides fun and entertainment for the whole family. There are tons of affordable attractions and activities for kids to take part in. Go ahead, let your kids get their face painted like a tiger, have their hair braided like a punk rocker or even line up for a press-on tatoo(don't worry nothing is permanent!)
Let them burn some energy in the bounce house or even take them for a walk through a fun house! Your kids will think you're the coolest parents around!

Take Me to Game City
The game section of the fair draws in just as many adults as it does children. Competing for stuffed animals and bragging rights, fair-goers enjoy a wide variety of entertainment. Popular gams include water gun races, shooting basketballs, ring tosses and popping balloons with darts!
