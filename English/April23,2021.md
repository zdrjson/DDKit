Cheese
Italy's cheeses are diverse, nuanced, and exquisite. Italian cheeses are often woven into the fabric of dinner (or breakfast, or lunch). Parmigano-Reggiano, the King of Cheese, is ubiquitous. It's grated over fresh pasta, or slivered atop asparagus. Ricotta is for drizzling with good olive oil scooping up with crusty bread, or baking into lasagne or cheese cake. Wedges of pecorino Toscano are perfect salads, and mozzarella was made for pizza.
