What are Auxiliary Verbs?
An auxiliary verb is a word that is added to the main verb of the sentence. In English, we need to use auxiliary verbs to show things like tense, mood, aspect, and voice. You may not know what all these words are, but you probably know the difference between them. For example, have a look at a sentence and its passive counterpart.
The dog bit the boy.
The boy was bitten by the dog.
Do you see the auxiliary verb? It is added to the main verb, so it is sometimes also called a helping verb. There will not always be auxiliary verbs in s sentence, as with the first sentence above, There can, however, be as many as three auxiliary verbs associated with one main verb.
