Superstitious
Different ways of looking at unusual occurrences

Introduction
An idea is believed to be superstitious when there is no scientific evidence or logical ideas to support it.

A lot of superstitions are believed to be true by people because of certain coincidences. For example, a person who had a lucky occurrence might decide that it was the new red underpants that he was wearing that brought him the good luck.

Other people determine that a superstition is true based on the high frequency of occurrences of the event. For example, Joe believes that the house located a block away from where he lives is haunted because a lot of car accidents have happened in front of it.
