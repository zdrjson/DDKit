What is a Hyperbole?
Hyperbole comes from a Greek word meaning "excess of exaggeration". In modern English, hyperboles are figures of speech that over exaggerate a situation.

Example:
I'm doing a million things right now.
(Meaning: I'm very busy)

Many western people like to use hyperboles because they believe it helps them express their thoughts and feeling with more passion. But take these hyperboles with a grain of salt. Most likely they are not meant to be taken literally.
