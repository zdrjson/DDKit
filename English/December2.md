Gardens And Gardening
The Asian way of gardening is very different from the European way. This difference is also reflected in art. Asian gardeners always wanted to approach nature as organically as possible until the ultimate unification with the natural world could be achieved. While Europeans admire nature's beauty, the goal is to reshape the natural world. The European idea of gardening has changed fundamentally across the centuries, paving the way for landscape gardens. The passion for gardening can build bridges between different people and different cultures.

Do you have a favorite garden style? If yes, what are its features?

A garden is a place where you can relax after a day at work. With just a little imagination, any space around the house can be transformed into the perfect garden. You just have to prepare the suitable soil for the seeds you intend to plant and to get several indispensable tools: a trowel, a watering hose, a wheelbarrow, a roundhead shovel, a rake, shears, and a pitchfork. It's better to start with plants that grow easily. Most importantly: relax! You'll have achievements and failures, but the fun of gardening is to grow along with plants.
