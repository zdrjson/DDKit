Slumping Celtics host hot Wizards in play-in game
The Boston Celtics ended the regular season in a deep slump, while the Washington Wizards soared to the finish line.

Their paths will converge Tuesday night when the Celtics host the Wizards in the play-in round. The winner will and the No. 7 seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs, while the loser will get another attempt to play their way in on Thursday night.

"The play-in games are going to be exciting for fans and it puts an added weight and added importance on that week," Boston coach Brad Stevens said. "And then once you get into the playoffs and teams dial into each other and prepare for each other, you see everybody's level rise."

The Celtics (36-36), who finished seventh in the Eastern Conference, need to raise their level now as they struggled down the stretch with five losses in six games and nine of their past 13.

They also lost standout guard Jaylen Brown (wrist) for the rest of the season. He averaged 24.7 points per game and losing Brown's firepower hurts even more when the opponent trots out Brandley Beal and Russell Westbrook as the starting backcourt.
