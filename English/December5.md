Introduction
What is the difference between I did and I have done? When is it appropriate to use will for the future? When is it correct to say used to do and when is it correct to say used to doing? Such grammar points can be confusing to ESL students. This series will focus on English grammar, while using examples to explain the rules. Today we will consider countable and uncountable nouns.

Countable nouns can be singular (carrot) or plural (carrots). Uncountable nouns only have one form (rice). With countable nouns, we can use numbers. We can say "one carrot," or "five carrots", etc. We cannot use numbers when talking about uncountable nouns, we can't say "one rice," "three rices," etc.
