Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe/Zambia
Victoria Falls is situated where the calm flowing waters of the Zambezi river encounter the edge of Victoria Falls gorge. The 1,700-meter-wide falls plunge 100 meters to the bottom of the gorge. The massive amounts of water impacting the river below generate massive mists and a thunderous sound that can be seen and heard from a great distance away. During rainy seasons, the falls virtually disappear behind the thick mist.
