The Most Dangerous Roads
In the World

Introduction
Outdoorsmen with adventurous spirits are all too familiar with hairy driving situations. Many of the world's best hikes, climbs, whitewater rapids, campgrounds, ski resorts, etc. are in remote areas, and accessing them can be an adventure in itself. Modern road construction technology, like tunnels, retaining walls, and guardrails, may eliminate some of the hazards, but in less developed places, you won't be so lucky. There are also non-natural dangers, like warzones and bandits. Let's look at the most dangerous roads on our planet.

The Death Road - Bolivia
Bolivia's Old Yungas Road, also known as "Death Road", is 40 miles of winding road that connects the high Andean capital city of La Paz to Coroico, 11,500 feet below of trucks, cars, and buses have misjudged its sharp turns over the years, plunging off the guardrail less cliffs into the canyon below. One such incident involved a bus carrying over 100 passengers. The road has become a tourist attraction for gutsy mountain bikers, even though it still kills over 100 people every year.
