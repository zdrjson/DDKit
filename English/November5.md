Find It Fried

There are two things you need to know about fair food: it's unhealthy and it's DELICIOUS! Everything seems to be bigger at the fair! Some fair staples include cotton candy, funnel cakes, French fries, corn dogs, sausage with onions and peppers and an array of deep-tried treats! These days, you can find deep fried pickles, onions, Oreos, Twinkies and even deep-fried ice cream!

What kind of food would you try at the fair?

The Rides
Do you enjoy the thrill of amusement park rides? If so, you'd most likely be a fan of the rides found at the fair. These heart-pounding rides are sure to get your adrenaline rushing! The Wild Claw, for example, is definitely not for the faint-hearted!
If you want to enjoy the scenery of the fair, in a more relaxing way, buy some tickets and get in line for the Ferries wheel - an oldie but a goodie! A word to the wise: just make sure you haven't hoovered too much funnel cake before strapping in or you may be likely to toss your cookies!

Country Music
The fair usually ends with a bang on the lat Saturday night with a country music band giving a live performance. These band are usually no-namers at small fairs, but at the much bigger state fairs, big names in country often perform. Make sure to buy your tickets in advance to catch country stars such as Taylor Swift, Sugarland, Kenny Chesney and more!

Study tip: Most students find country music much easier to understand than other genres, so check out some country jams for extra practice outside of class!
