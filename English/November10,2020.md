4. Emphatic Phrases
Sometimes confrontation is necessary to resolve a situation. To complain about people who avoid conflict you could say:
You should seriously grow a spine and face the music, sister.
Okay, all that I really want is for you to stop avoiding responsibility so we can make this project the best it can be.
Some people are too afraid of conflict to openly discuss issues that need to be dealt with.
I would genuinely prefer it if you told me things directly so we could foster more positive communications.

6. Emphatic Phrases
Once in a while, it's necessary to instigate conflict to get people to face vital issues:
Alright. That's it. This backstabbing has gotta stop now, or I'm totally gonna lose it on you. Understand?
Thanks, but not thanks. Quite frankly, I'd really prefer it if you kept your meddling hands off of my work so I can follow through as planned.

Key Point
Sometimes when we learn a new English phrase or word we might over do it. We use it all the time, to the point it might become a drag for anyone we know to listen to us because they can already guess what you are going to say. If you overuse emphatic expressions about evasive action, you'll either sound really irresponsible or overly critical of others.
Key point: don't over emphatic expressions. Using one per sentences is enough. Use them only to express yourself clearly, not by over doing so you should over dramatic.
