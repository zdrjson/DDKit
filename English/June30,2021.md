Discussion
1. How would you handle the supplier after what happened?
2. Have you heard of something like this happening before?
3. Has a company ever sent you the wrong thing before?

Background of Company
You work for a company called Quality Motor Repairs, which specializes in repairing motorcycle engines. Customers ship motorcycles to your repair center where they are either fixed or sent to other repair companies that can fix them.

This is the repair business, so repairs do not always go perfectly well, but you can keep complaints to a minimum if you address them correctly and make policies that correct previous issues.
A customer has just sent you an email. Let's see what he has to say.
