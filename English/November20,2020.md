"Some" and "Any"

Introduction
What is the difference between some and any? How and when do you use them? Such grammar points can be confusing ESL students. This series will focus on English grammar, while using examples to explain the rules. Today we will consider the words, some and any.

Some and Any

Generally we use some(somebody/something/someone) in positive sentences and any (anybody, etc.) in negative sentences:

some                          any

There is someone in the room. There is not anyone in the room.

Any(negative)
You use any in these sentences because they are negative:

(almost nobody did their homework)

(he did not take any money with him)
Some and Any in Questions
Some and any are both used in questions.
Some is used to talk about a person or thing that we think or know exists:
Are you looking for somebody?
ï¼ˆI think you are looking for somebody)
Some is used in questions when offering or asking for things.
Do you want something to drink?
(there is something to drink)

(there is probably some pizza I can eat)

Any in Questions
In most questions you use any. We do not know if the person or thing exists:
