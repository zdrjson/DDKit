Introduction

You are very excited. Your boss has just told you that she is moving to another department - and she things that you are the prefect person to step into her shoes. If you get the job, it will mean more vocation days and business travel, not to mention a big pay increase.

Hold your horses!

If this is your first management job, look before you leap. There are certainly advantages to working in low-level management, but there are disadvantages too:

disciplining employees

managing conflict in your team, and with other managers

meeting difficult targets

balancing what your employees want, with what higher management wants
