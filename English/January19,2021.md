This is my story of what happened.
It's the story of what I saw, felt, and thought during two of the most intense years I've ever experienced.
It's the story of what led me to this crossroads of American history and how I kept going after a shocking defeat; how I reconnected with the things that matter most to me and began to look ahead with hope, instead of backward with regret.
It's also the story of what happened to our country, why we're so divided, and what we can do about it.
I don't have all the answers, and this isn't a comprehensive account of the 2016 race. That's not for me to write -- I have too little distance and too great a stake in it. Instead, this is my story. I want to pull back the curtain on an experience that was exhilarating, joyful. humbling, infuriating, and just plain baffling.
Writing this wasn't easy. Every day that I was a candidate for President, I knew that millions of people were counting on me, and I couldn't bear the idea of letting them down. But I did. I could't get the job done, and I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life.
In this book, I write about moments from the campaign that I wish I could go back and do over. If the Russians could hack my subconscious, they'd find a long list. I also capture some moments I want to remember forever, like when my tiny granddaughter raced into the room while I was practicing my convention speech, and what is was like hours later to step onstage to deliver that speech as the first woman ever nominated by a major political party for President of the United States.
