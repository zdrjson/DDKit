Vacation Ideas(cont)
Jay: Mexico sounds nice. But how about somewhere we haven't been? Let's be adventurous.

Alice: And exotic! You know, I heard Thailand beaches are practically paradise... But we swing it with our budget?

Jay: We actually managed to save a little more than expected this year, with my bonus and all. Let's do it!

What to Eat
Almost every day we discuss with others about what to eat. Here are a couple students discussing ideas.

Sue: I'm starving! I could barely focus during that last class with my stomach growling like thatã€‚

Amie: Yeah, let's eat. Should we hit the diner, or try something new?

Sue: Ah, I'm getting tired of the diner. Let's have foreign food, Mexican?
