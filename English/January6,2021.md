What to Eat
Almost every day we discuss with others about what to eat. Here are a couple students discussing ideas.

Sue: I'm starving! I could barely focus during that last class with my stomach growling like that.

Amie: Yeah, let's eat. Should we hit the diner, or try something new?

Sue: Ah, I'm getting tired of the diner. Let's have foreign food. Mexican?
