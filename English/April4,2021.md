Investigating Potential Markets
When the category a product falls into is known, exporters can find out how other products falling into the same category are treated. Looking at where products are going to and coming from helps exporters to understand the potential of different markets. If a lot of people are exporting the same product, the market might be too crowded. However, a crowed market can be a sign of growth, and there are be room for more exporters.
