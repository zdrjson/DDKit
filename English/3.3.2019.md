Bicycles
 Being bicycle-friendly is a trend amongst cities geared at tourism. In cities such as Amsterdam and Munster, there are more bicycles than residents, which accounts for the abundance of bike paths, bike traffic lights, and bike rack. Students go about their way primarily by bike. Renting a bike in Europe costs nearly nothing.
 
In fact, Paris recently rolled out 10,600 bicycles for the public to use practically for free. Similar public bike programs can be found in Lyon, Brussels, Vienna, Helsinki, Oslo, Copenhagen, and elsewhere.
