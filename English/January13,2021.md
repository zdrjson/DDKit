What to Eat(cont)
Amie: I had Mexican last night. Don't want to overdo it.

Sue: Ok, how about that Chinese place on the corner?

Amie: That's an option... but I'm getting kind of tired of them, too. I know! There's a Caribbean place down the street; today's their grand opening and they have special discount prices add day!

Sue: Sounds perfect. Let's get there before the dinner rush.
