Everyone Can Pitch In
Everyone can pitch in when making a family meal. Involve kids of all ages with the planning, shopping, and preparation of the meals. These are important life skills that could help your children establish healthy eating habits in the future. Furthermore, cooking together is a great way to connect, strengthen family bonds, and best of all, have a great time together!

If you aren't comfortable in the kitchen, you can begin by cooking simple, familiar recipes. This will help ensure you are enjoying your time together, rather than stressing out about what you're making.
