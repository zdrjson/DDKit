Your Turn

Coca-Cola started to offer Diet Coke in 1992, which proved to be a successful product. The product had a clear diet and weight-loss positioning and was focused on the female market.
In 1993, their competitor, PepsiCo, introduced Pepsi Max. Pepsi Max was also a diet drink, but what was unusual about this was that there was already a drink called Diet Pepsi - a diet and female-oriented positioned beverage. In order to differentiate the product, Pepsi Max was marked to young adult males who enjoyed a fun lifestyle. Pepsi emphasized the "no sugar" attribute in advertisements, without mentioning the word "diet".
It was not until 2005 that Coca-Cola introduced their matching product - Coke Zero. It was also advertised as "no sugar" but targeted Coke drinkers of all demographics.
