Introduction
The piano's lace of portability, high price tag, and need for professional tuning have done little to diminish its appeal - it it truly international, and is found in almost every style of music. The name 'piano' is a short form of the original 'pianoforte': a joining of the Italian words for 'soft' and 'loud'. This is a reference to the instrument's ability to produce a variety of tones, depending on how the keys are pressed.
