Qualities required
The secret of doing well in an interview is to know what to bring to the table. For example, some may say you need to show your skills. But the reason you are in the interview room is because your prospective employer knows that you have the skills. What they are looking for are those qualities that don't always show on paper. What are they?

Can You Answer?
Do you think discussing your skills is very important in an interview?

What is one way you would answer the question, "What are your weaknesses?"

One weakness I have is overcommitment to things. I have realized that it is important for me to say "no" sometimes, so that I can give 100% to the projects I am working on.

Is it possible to have too much energy?
It's certainly possible to have too much energy. In this case, it could be distracting from your answers and make you look not professional.

Ambition
Some employers are just looking to fill a seat. Data input doesn't require too much ambition. But if you are applying for a job that requires innovation and risk-taking, you must show you have a keen understanding of the nature of the job and that you are willing to push beyond the present boundaries. Some companies are looking for a candidate who will offer them more than they are asking for.
