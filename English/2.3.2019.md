Taxia
   A legitimate taxi always has a meter and two-way radio inside. Make sure these instruments are in the taxi before you get in and feel free to wave the cab by if you don't see them. A taxi may not use a meter and still be safe, but one without radio calls for alarm. Every taxi needs communicate with a base - without a real radio, it may not be a real cab. Also, sharing a cab with strangers might seem like a safe idea and a good way to save money, but it's a scam in some places.
