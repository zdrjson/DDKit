Some advice for software engineers who want to get better, fast: don't try to learn too many new things all at once.

Don't try to learn three different programming languages at the same time.
Don't try to learn frontend development, machine learning, and infrastructure at the same time. 
Don't try toe learn React, TensorFlow, and Kubernetes at the same time.

You'll likely end up overwhelmed by a breadth of superficial knowledge and an accompanying lack of confidence, neither of which will get you very far.

Instead, focus on just one or two things, get really good at them, reap the rewards of being really good at them, and *then* start branching out, following the same focused process.
