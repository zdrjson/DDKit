Keep it Simple 
When participating in secret Santa or any other type of gift exchange with your colleagues, try to keep the gift simple and since, and always try to stay away from giving personal items. Giving a scent might sound like a great idea but you don't know if your co-worker might be allergic to perfumes, or if she just won't like the scent you picked for her, so try to keep it simple and give your colleague something useful.

What would you think if you received a nail clipper or deodorant as a gift from a co-worker?
