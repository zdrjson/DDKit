MAEKETING:
MAKING ARRANGEMENTS
BY PHONE

Introduction
Talking on the phone is one of the biggest fears for English language learners. Without the aid of hand gestures and body language, 100% of the comprehension in a phone call comes from relying on the learner's speaking and listening skills.

When speaking with foreigners, pronunciation has to be perfect. Otherwise, you can easily be misunderstood.

In this lesson, you will practice making arrangements by phone.
