WORLD WAR I
When Walt started high school, his family moved to Chicago. Walt took classes at the Chicago Art Institute and drew for the school newspaper.
When he was sixteen, he wanted to fight in World War I. Since he was still too young to join the army, he joined the Red Cross, driving ambulances in France.

an ambulance = an emergency medical vehicle

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
One failure did not stop him. In 1923, he moved to Hollywood and started a new business, with his brother Roy, called Disney Brothers' Studio.
He then hired animators. They created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the business was a success.
However, the company Universal Studios gained control of the Oswald trademark and took all of Disney's animators except for one.
