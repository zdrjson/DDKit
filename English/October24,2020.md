One of the best things you can do as a software engineer when joining a new company or team is to ask a lot of questions.

Ask questions about the product you're building.

Ask questions about the technologies you're using.

Ask questions about the codebase you're maintaining.

Ask questions about the expectations you're fulfilling.

Ask questions about the processes you're following.

You'll learn a ton, you'll be more productive, and you might even inadvertently uncover issues that lead to improvements for the company or team as a whole.

Ask questions.
