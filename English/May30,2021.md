History
In 490 BC, the Greeks defeated the Persians at the Battle of Marathon. According to legend, a Geek messenger ran the entire distance from Marathon to Athens, about 25 miles (40km), to tell the victory. Upon announcing "we have won," the messenger collapsed and died. When the modern Olympics began in 1896, the marathon was one of the competitions. The women's marathon did not become an Olympic even until 1984.

Develop Rules
Once unified goals and budget has been devised, the next step is to make family financial rules that each member must follow. For example, some families have a rule that each purchase, unless urgent, must be delayed for one week to allow time for a well-informed decision. Some families may also demand their members to reflect on the motives behind their buying decisions. For instance, if a purchase was conducted out of envy of other people's possessions, it should be prohibited. Solid financial rules can effectively reduce impulsive and unreasonable spending and help to construct a healthy financial status.
