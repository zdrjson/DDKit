Room Service
Do you feel so tired that you simply want to eat in your room? Maybe you are a business traveler, and you are going to be chained to your laptop for the evening. Instead of making dinner reservations, order room service.
Room service works in similar ways to regular restaurant service. The customer places an order, the cooks make the food, and the server delivers it, but right to your room!

Hotel Ratings
In the world of travel, a scale of one to five stars is used nearly universally to indicate the type of service travelers can expect from a hotel. The more stars, the higher quality of the hotel.
