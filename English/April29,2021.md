Many times, students get stuck and can't finish their sentences. They say, "I don't know how to say it...."

This is usually because they are thinking of a word in their native language that they don't know in English.

Here is a crazy tip: don't think about the words you don't know. Those words won't help you. If you don't know them, spending time thinking about what you don't know won't finish your sentence.

Instead, focus on the words you do know and try to explain the idea using words you know.

Thinking about the word you don't know will not help you magically know it. There will always be some words you don't know, so learning know to use the words you do know to explain what you want to say is a key skill.
