What is engineering?

Engineering is everywhere

Almost everything we use in modern life is made by engineers. For example, if a manufacturer wants a faster car, a smaller personal stereo, or a better pen, they will ask a design engineer to find a practical solution.

Engineering is both practical and theoretical

Engineers use theory to produce practical answers. The design solution must be a reasonable price, safe and reliable. A new idea that is expensive, dangerous, or doesn't always work, is not a good solution.
