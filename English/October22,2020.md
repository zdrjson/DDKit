Changing Communication
Psychologists have started to define terms like Facebook addiction in their reports. Social media sits can be so addicting that people, especially youngsters, do not want to spend time doing anything else - they live their life in a virtual world. People often choose to talk to each other via mobile phones, Skype, or Facebook because they may be afraid of getting to know each other face-to-face. However, by doing this, they are missing out on their partner's facial expressions or the gestures that the other makes. Emotions are reduced to "likes" or ""dislikes, smiley faces or other emoticons.

Psychology experts have also noticed that more and more marriages are breaking up. One of the reasons may be because Facebook makes it possible to communicate with old friends from high school or ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends that you have not had contact with in ages.

Less Real Communication
Also, couples are not communicating with each other as they should in real life. They sometimes even break up over Facebook and other social networks. Frequently, they do not argue about things in the usual way and tend to carry about quarrels in public. As a result, others comment about something that should be solved privately. They don't share their thoughts and feelings with each other, opting rather to share these thoughts and feelings with everyone else.

Discussion
1) Do you know anyone who you would consider addicted to social networking? Do you thing this is a serious thing?
2) Why do you think so many people are willing to share their private information for everyone to see online?
3) In your opinion, will actual face-to-face communication between people become even less common in the future?

Shy Creators
It is interesting to consider the fact that software developers and social network creators are, in real life, not really very social. Most of them are shy people who like to stick to their computers and do not create lasting friendships.

Changing the World
Facebook has defined privacy in a new way. Many things that should be private have become public. Social media has changed the world. Facebook, Twitter and other social media formats are omnipresent. They are the last things many people worry about before going to bed and the first thing they check when they up.

The Future
In the future, more social networks may pop up. We will be able to not only share personal stories and photos with others, but also any other private information we choose. The more followers a person has and the more likes they get, the more excited they are, which leads people to share more and more private information.
