What's the difference between a department store and a shopping mall?

A department store is all 1 store, it just has different areas inside the store. For example, Macy's is a US Department store. When you go into Macy's you can find a department for women's shoes or a department for handbags or a department for jewelry -- but it's all the same store (Macy's) If you buy something, your receipt says "Macy's".

A shopping mall is a very large building with many separate stores. Each store could be owned by someone different -- there are many shops and these shops are not owned by the same company.

In the US, most shopping malls have at least 2 department stores inside the mall and MANY other stores. A shopping mall might have 100 stores or more.
