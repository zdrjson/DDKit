Anxiety- Actually, a small amount of nervousness is good because it can keep you on your toes. However, if speaking in English is turning into a phobia, it might be time for you to chill out and try speaking English in more relaxing atmospheres.

If people are always asking you to repeat yourself several times, that should definitely be a wake up call that you are either incoherent, your voice is too soft, or your accent is making it hard for people to understand you.

Don't leave out the consonant at the end of a word! It can totally change the meaning and connotation of a sentence.

If I say, "Susan has a lot of weeds in her garden."
What does "weeds" mean?
