Schedule a Time to Connect
It doesn't matter whether you choose breakfast, lunch, or dinner, to have a meal together. Just be sure to choose the time that gives you the best opportunity to talk and connect. If it's uncommon for you to eat meals together, then start by scheduling one meal per week, and increasing the number over time.

Also, be sure to choose healthy, nutritional foods to eat together. If you have hectic schedules, do your best to schedule activities so they don't interface with mealtimes. The best option, once you've decided when you're going to eat together, is to mark it on your calendar. If it's planned, it's much more likely to happen.
