Sleep and Brain
Unlike the resilient human body, our brain is one of the most intricate and delicate working systems known to man. The human brain can only work for so long without taking a break, and sleep is exactly what it needs to rejuvenate itself. Therefore, we can say that sleep directly and indirectly affects our learning ability and memory.

Sleeping Debt
One of the most pronounced functions of sleep is to rid one of tiredness. People fee refreshed after a good night sleep, while those who don't have a good night sleep tend to become fatigued more easily during the day. Our body needs sleep to replenish stamina, but not as much as our mind needs it.
