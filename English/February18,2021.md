More Movement
Adding more activity will lead to losing at least some weight. If you don't think you can handle a structured disciplined program, just start small! Every little bit will help. Let's look at easy ways to start:
Turn the TV off. At least one day a week, leave the TV off. Instead, do something physical. Try playing games with your family, going for a walk, or pretty much anything more active then sitting on the couch.

More Movement
Walk. Find ways to make yourself walk more each day. For example, when you go outside to get the mail, take a stroll around the block. If you have a dog, take him for an extra walk each day. Take a 5-minute walk on your treadmil before work.

More chores. Do some more gardening, rake the leaves, sweep your floors, vacuum, and more. These aren't vigorous exercises, but they keep your body moving, and you maintain your home in the process!
