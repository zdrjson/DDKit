It's About Being Together
Mealtime is all about being together as a family and helping children feel loved, safe, and secure. Focus your attention on enjoying each other's company, rather than on what or how much your children are eating. This is also a great time to teach your children about some family values and traditions.

Try keeping the conversation light-hearted and positive. This will help encourage your children to talk about their days and develop better communication between family members. If there is a need for a difficult or disciplinary conversation, schedule it for some time other than during meals.
