Country Music
The fair usually ends with a bang on the last Saturday night with a country music band giving a live performance. These bands are usually no-namers at small fairs, but at the much bigger state fairs, big names in country often perform. Make sure to buy your tickets in advance to catch country stars such as Taylor Swift, Sugarland, Kennney Chesney and more!

Study tip: Most students find country music much easier to understand than other genres, so check out some country jams for extra practice outside of class!
