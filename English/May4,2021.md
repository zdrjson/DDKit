Sleep
Most people take sleep for granted. People who live in a modern society tend to sacrifice their sleep for careers, social interactions, or leisure activities, such as surfing on the internet, watching TV or movies, or simply spending time with their family and friends.

Sleeping Debt
However, sacrificing our sleep comes at a price. When people allocate the time they should spend on sleeping for other purposes, they are creating "Sleep debt." Unlike a financial debt, once you find yourself in a sleep debt, it's not as simple as paying back what you owe.
