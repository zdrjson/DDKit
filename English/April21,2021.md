Self-Introduction
I specialize in reading, pronunciation, public speaking, business English and travel. I believe learning a language should be fun, so I bring a lot of passion, energy and enthusiasm to the classroom. Using visualization is one of my best teaching methods. I look forward to meeting you!

How are your day? It's ok, but nothing to write home about.
There is nothing very interesting or exciting to tell my family or friends.

Note
Dear Huahua, With this finds you well. This is a non-CS friend that recently received a job offer in the Bay area that benefited a lot from watching your videos. I would say your videos on coding provide tremendous help to me throughout my entire job hunt process. Your video has been consistently high-quality with your codes highly clean and readable at the textbook level. I just wanna say thank you. I wish I could learn more from you in the future. Sincerely yours, your fan
