Travel Words
In this day and age, modern travel provides us many opportunities to explore our world. Since the Wright brothers took to the skies over the beaches at Kitty Hawk in 1903, tourist travel has come a long way. For most tourists, the airplane is the quintessential mode to transport to get to their dream destination. Once there, travelers rely on other means of transport to get from one tourist site to another.
