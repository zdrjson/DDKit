The Text
The first tip for creating an eye-catching ad is to choose the font wisely. A company can have the perfect product, pictures, colors, etc. in the ad, but if the font is inappropriate, that is what people are going to notice. That means the font can actually have a significant impact on the success of an ad. It should be brief, easy to read with normal punctuation and capitalization. Texts that are in huge, chunky blocks and in all capitals are hard on the eyes, and people will immediately lose interest and move on. All capital letters have the effect that the company is screaming at people to pay attention, which ironically accomplishes the complete opposite.
Questions:
1. Do you agree or disagree that fonts are important? Explain.
2. Have you seen an ad that you liked with a poor choice of font?
