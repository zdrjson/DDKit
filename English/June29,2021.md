Email From Customer
To Quality Motor Repairs,

I have just received my motorcycle back from a company that I did not send my motorcycle to. It was disassembled and rusted. The motorcycle was in a wooden box, and the only reason I knew it was mine is because it is the same color and brand. The box says it came from a company called Expert Repairs. Please let me know how and if we get this resolved.

Best regards,
Joe Edison
