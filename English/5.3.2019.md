Tipping etiquette
   Tourists often do not know how much and when to tip, and to be ignorant about these kind of things may result in poor service.
   Tipping etiquette differs from one country to another. For example, in Japan, waiters will often run after patrons to return the cash they "forgot" on a table. In New York, however, if you leave a top less then 15%, a second reservation at that establishment will be out of the question. Whenever you travel to a foreign country, it is best to find out beforehand what the standard tipping rates are.
   
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
  With regard to tipping at restaurants in the US, establishments expect patrons to add 15 to 20% to their bills. Some restaurants automatically include the service charge in the bill.
  In neighboring Canada, waiters count on a tip of between 10-15%. The 5% margin depends on whether you are in the French-speaking or English-speaking part of the country, and on how good the service is.
  The same percentage applies for dining at eateries in the UK. At a pub, if a bartender takes good care of you, it is good form to buy him or her a drink.
