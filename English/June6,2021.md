Tips For Food Safety
Wash cutting boards and knives with hot soapy water, especially after cutting raw meat, poultry or seafood.
Never place food on the same surface that held raw meat, poultry or seafood, unless it has been washed.
Use visual signs to check if food is cooked;
Pork, veal and poultry are white inside, not pink or red
Steam rises from food
Clear, not pink juices, run from meat and poultry
Shellfish is opaque, and fish flakes easily when cut 
Egg yolks are film, not runny, egg whites are opaque
