The Venetian
The resort opened on May 3, 1999, with a flutter of white doves, sounding trumpets and signers. Rising 145 meters high, and built at a cost of USD1.5 billion, it was one of the most expensive resorts of its kind when it opened. The venetian is home to the second most profitable club in Las Vegas, the TAO nightclub. It is also home to the Blue Man Group, which is three performers who produce theatrical shows and concerts featuring experimental music (with an emphasis on percussion).
