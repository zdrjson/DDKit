What makes a great software engineer?

From what I observed at Google and Facebook, there isn't a single thing that you have to do to be a great software engineer, and there certainly isn't a formulaic path to becoming a great software engineer.

Great software engineers come in all shapes, colors, and flavors; some are "coding machines" who pump out insane amounts of code, others are domain experts who are at the forefront of their field, and others again are team leads who use their soft skills to enable other software engineers to thrive.

If you're worried that you don't have it takes to be a great software engineer, realize that "what it takes" isn't carved in stone and that your unique skillset is precisely what make you a great software engineer.


Here are 4 tips to stand out as a Software Engineer.

1) Become an expert in a niche area of software development (e.g., CSS, bash scripting, version control, etc.)-- you'll be the go-to person whenever someone on your team needs help in that domain.

2) Take initiative, whether it be starting and leading a project, volunteering to onboard a new engineer, or taking it upon yourself to clean up some tech debt.

3) Do work that others don't like doing: refactoring code, writing documentation, etc.. Your teammates will appreciate it, and you might find yourself indirectly doing tips1 and 2)

4) Hone your communication skills--specifically, be the bridge between the engineers and the other stakeholders on your team (designers, product managers, writers, etc.).
