Reading

In 1913, the father of Indian cinema, D. Phalke, released India's first full-length feature film called Raja Harishchandra. The silent film marked the start of Bollywood, the Hollywood of Bombay (now Mumbai). Later, silent films would change to "talkies". Actors then sang for their audiences, and this remains the signature of the quintessential Hindi film. The 1950s began the Golden Age of Indian cinema. This period provided a strong impetus to the industry, with themes changing to social issues relevant at the time. Movies became a potent medium to critically acclaimed films of all time. The masala film - a mix of action, comedy, romance, and drama- burst onto the scene in the 1970s. This was Bollywood's heyday.
