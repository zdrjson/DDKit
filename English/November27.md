After only 5 visits, Robert called off the visits because they were causing severe emotional distress in the Mays' home.

The Twiggs sued for custody, but they lost in state court. Not wanting to give their daughter up, the Twiggs decided to appeal to a higher court.

Kimberly, who was fourteen at the time, decided enough was enough. She wanted to make the Twiggs leave her alone. She went to court in order to terminate the Twiggs' rights as her natural parents. In effect, she wanted to divorce her parents.

What the court decided
