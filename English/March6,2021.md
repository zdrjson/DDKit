Retro Music

How many times have you heard people say, "They just don't make music like they used to!"
For people like this, there's nothing better than listening to oldies. It's even better if they can find an original vinyl that they can play on a record player.
In recent years, there has been a pop music backlash due to the perceived commercialization of the industry. This has caused many musicians, especially rock and roll musicians, to look at music genres of the past for inspiration. As an example, Muse, a modern rock band, has been compared to famous music legends of the past, like Queen, and Pink Floyd.

Vinyl - a recording on a long-play record
Commercialization - to do, make, or exploit for financial gain.
