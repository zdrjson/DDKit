Be Discreet 
If you are planning on giving a gift to a co-worker or to your boss, do it privately. You don't want everyone at the office gossiping about why you gave your colleague a gift. You should avoid making a show in front of colleagues or management.

Have you ever given a gift just to make a public display of your generosity?

Don't spend too Much
If you give an extravagant, expensive gift, some colleagues might think you are just doing it because you expect to get something in return or because you want to outshine the rest of your co-workers. Giving this type of present does not make you look good and usually makes the recipient feel uncomfortable.

How much would you say is reasonable to spend on a gift for a co-worker?
