How Some Superstitions Become True...

Some argue that a superstitious belief might come true because they become self-fulfilling prophecies.

A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction of the future that becomes fulfilled subliminally by a person who believes it to be a true prediction.

In other words, the prediction influences the person's behavior so much that they make it come true without realizing it. For example, a man visits a fortune teller who tells him that he will soon meet a tall, dark-haired woman who he will eventually marry. Because of this, he ignores all women that don't match this description, and then marries the first tall, dark-haired woman that he dates.
