Conversations About Expressing Your Ideas

Introduction
In today's lesson, we'll review some language that may be used when expressing our ideas to others.
Everyday conversations like these can be challenging if they're in a second language, so we'll look at some common language we can use when we want to be share our ideas in English!

Ideas in a Business Meeting
Working meetings generally host an abundance of idea swapping. Let's look in on a meeting.

Phil: Thanks guys for coming. As you know, we need some fresh ideas for our next sales campaign to motivate the team. The floor is open.

Mike: Well, Phil, I was thinking we could throw in some incentives for top performers. Perhaps a cash bonus or extra days off?

Pill: Good start. We've already started playing with some numbers. Anything else?

Ideas in a Business Meeting(cont)
Kelly: I was thinking of utilizing recognition for good performance, such as creating "sales team member of the month" plaques.

Terry: We could also include articles about high performers in company newsletters.

Phil: Well those are things we haven't tried! Good thinking. Let's put these in motion, and if anyone else comes up with more ideas, my door's always open.

Ideas for a Team Project

Team projects are a common part of school and work life. Let's see how this team expresses their ideas.

Mandy: So, how should we handle this case study assignment on Google? Want to throw out some ideas?

Jerry: Well, it will probably be best to split up the work between us, with recurring meetings to check on our team progress.

Ideas for a Team Project(cont)

Elise: Well, that's a good idea. How should we divvy it up though?
Nick: I was thinking about this, too. Well, we can have each person cover a core subject we need to discuss. How about Mandy takes company history, Jerry covers business model and finance, Elise can cover sales and marketing, and I can cover competition analysis?

Mandy: That sounds good, and we can reconvene in a week to review the progress and discuss any concerns.

Ben: Guys, we've been glued to the TV for 3 hours now, I'm bored.

Richard: Yeah, let's do something else. But what.

Tom: That's the golden question... Maybe we could go bowling.

Ben: I suck at bowling.

What to Do with Your Friends(cont)
Richard: Well, you got any bright ideas?

Ben: We could catch a football game.

Tom: But I'm strapped for cash. How about something cheap?

Richard: Okay, how about we call up the other guys and get our own football game going?

Ben: Now we're talking. Will that fly with you Tom?

Tom: Okay, I'm in.

Vacation Ideas

Where to go on vacation is often a debate in itself. Let's se this couple discuss it;

Alice: Honey, have you given any though about where to go for our next vacation?

Jay: Well, we did that ski trip last time, how about somewhere warm this year?

Alice: Yeah, I agree. I'm feeling a white sandy beach and warm water.... Mexico?

Vacation Ideas(cont)
Jay: Mexico sounds nice. But how about somewhere we haven't been? Let's be adventurous.

Alice: And exotic! You know, I heard Thailand beaches are practically paradise... But can we swing it with our budget?

Jay: We actually managed to save a little more than expected this year, with my bonus and all. Let's do it!
