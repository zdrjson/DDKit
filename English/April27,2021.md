Practice Self-Regulation
Being aware of your emotions is a crucial first step, but you also need to be able to control these emotions.
Self-regulation helps people to resist impulsive behaviors that might worsen the situation and develop a flexible range of emotional responses that are well-suited to the situation.

1. Reframe negative thoughts. Take a step back from your own thoughts and feelings, analyze them and come up with positive alternative thoughts.
2. Stay calm under pressure. Remove your mind from the situation for moment and try relaxation techniques like deep breathing.
