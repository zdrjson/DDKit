The Most Dangerous Roads In The World

Introduction
Outdoorsmen with adventurous spirits are all too familiar with hairy driving situations. Many of the world's best hike, climbs, whitewater rapids, campgrounds, ski resorts, etc. are in remote areas, and accessing them can be an adventure in itself. Modern road construction technology, like tunnels, retaining wall, and guardrails, may eliminate some of the hazards, but in less developed places, you won't be so lucky. There are also non-natural dangers, like warzones and bandits. Let's look at the most dangerous roads on our planet.

The Death Road - Bolivia
Bolivia's Old Yungas Road, also known as "Death Road", is 40 miles of winding road that connects the high Andean capital city of La Paz to Coroico, 11,500 feet below in the Amazon basin.
Hundreds of trucks, cars and buses have misjudged its sharp turns over the years, plunging off the guardrail-less cliffs into the canyon below. One such incident involved a bus carrying over 100 passengers. The road has become a tourist attraction for gutsy mountain bikers, even though it still kills over 100 people every year.

The Million Dollar Highway - Colorado
The Million Dollar Highway, located in Colorado's southwest, is idyllic, for the most part. Motorists enjoy breathtaking views along the alpine road, crossing through three 10,000-plus-foot mountain passes. However, for 12 miles of the road, drivers are exposed to unprotected cliffs. The road becomes steep, twisting, and originally hand-carved by a Russian immigrant in the 1880s, and remains open through the snowy winter months Locals say "you'd have to pay me a million dollars" to drive the stretch in the snow.

Trollstigen - Norway
The picture says it all. This serpentine road, whose name translates so "Troll's Way", winds through 11 extremely tight turns at grades up to 10% on its way up a 2,790-foot mountain pass. It's also easy to become distracted by a 1,050-foot waterfall that tumbles down along the route and into the valley below. The road has now become a tourist attraction, and draws 2,500 vehicles daily during tourist season.

Federal Highway 1 - Mexico
Federal Highway 1 is the only road that links the remote towns and villages of Baja Peninsula. This narrow, two-lane road is shared by freight trucks, oversized RVs, and pretty much every other type of vehicle on the 1,000-mile-long peninsula. It gets particularly hairy as it twists through the mountains and hugs the coastline between the hills and the sea. Expect to see many places where the guardrails were split open by previous accidents.

Guoliang Tunnel - China
The treacherous Guoliang Tunnel was carved into a cliffside to connect the mountaintop village of Guoliang to the rest of the world. Before the road, the only way to access the village was through a steep stairway called the "Sky Ladder". The villagers pleaded with the government for years for a road, to no avail. They eventually literally took matters into their own hands, carving out the 16-foot-tall, 13-foot-wide tunnel. The road twists, turns, and dips unpredictably, ass you would expect from a do-it-yourself project.
