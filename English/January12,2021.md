It happens every time. Something awful transpires -- something that indicates the venality of the nation's leaders or certain of its people -- and we are treated to the same refrain by swaths of the newly-shocked: namely, "This isn't the America we know."

It happened after Hurricane Katrina when hundreds of thousands of mostly Black people were left to feed for themselves or die in New Orleans.
Although social media wasn't a thing yet -- this was 2005, when the Earth was young -- you could still hear the surprise from commentators in mainstream media, on websites, and via e-mail listservs.

"How could this happen in our country?" the voices intoned. People stranded on rooftops, waiting for rescue from helicopters that in many cases never came. Thousands of people gathered without food or water in the Superdome or Convention Center, their government at all levels -- federal, state, and local -- having failed to protect them. Watching the horror unfold on national television, they intoned that this "wasn't the America they know."
