Do not reward poor service
   A tip should always go hand in hand with good service. There is no reason to reward poor service. Travelers should always feel free to withhold a tip with a clear conscience whenever they get a raw deal. On the other hand, tourists should not make outrageous demands that are impossible to meet.
   
   On a parting note, please make sure to tip the attendants in public bathrooms at train station, museums, and parks all over Europe. It is common practice there.
   
Why tips?
     Penny pinchers, especially, often do not see the point of tipping. Why should they just give out their hard-earned cash? There are, however, advantages to complying with this courteous practice. For one thing, it's a great way to ensure good service when you visit a place again. Some consumers even use tips as a way to reward attentive service, and to punish poor service. Furthermore, people in the service industry rely on gratuities for their livelihood, so by tipping you are helping someone who has already helped you have a better day!
