Read this story about a girl in Florida who wanted to divorce her parents
When Kimberly Mays was nine years old, her father Robert told her some terrible news: He and his late wife Barbara were not Kimberly's biological parents. Her biological parents were Ernest and Regina Twigg, who lived in Pennsylvania.

In 1988, the Twiggs' daughter Arlena died of a heart defect. Blood tests revealed that Arlena and Kimberly, who were both born in the same rural hospital in Florida, had been switched at birth.

Thus, the girl who died, Arlena, was actually the Mays' biological daughter and Kimberly was actually the Twiggs' biological daughter.

Once they knew the truth, the Twiggs sought more contact with Kimberly. In a 1989 agreement, the Twiggs agreed not to seek custody of Kimberly in return for visitation rights.
