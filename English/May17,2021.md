#1 in the moment
Being or living in the moment means being mindfully aware of what is going on right here and now. A lot of the time we may be like robots, living our daily lives carrying out habitual patterns. These tendencies could take over and run our lives and so at times we need to stop and experience the moment.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. When you want to state an opinion but admit there is an opposing viewpoint, this phrase fits well. We use whom because it is the object of the sentence. Who works as the subject.

Depending on whom ask, the coffee here is pretty good.
