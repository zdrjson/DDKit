Health & Social Benefits
Studies have shown that when people eat together, they are more likely to indulge in vegetables, fruits, and other nutrient-rich foods - rather than junk food. This often results in healthier eating in adulthood, healthier body weight, and lower risk of eating disorders.

Furthermore, eating together gives kids the chance to learn new words and improve their communication skills. The result is fewer behavioral problems, better self-esteem, less depression, and better grades in school. However, keep in mind that the benefits of eating together are most noticeable if you disconnect from all technological devices throughout the meal.
