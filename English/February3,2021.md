A few weeks ago, after 11 1/2 years, I left Amazon. It wasn't an easy decision over the last decade my professional growth was fueled by the rapidity of Amazon's ascendence, and I'll be forever grateful for the opportunities the company afforded me, and for the deep, personal relationships I developed along the way. So thanks, Amazon-you're amazing (and believe me when I say that this change is about me, not you).

On Monday, I start at Google. I'm excited to set aside old habits, learn new ways of working, dive back into first principles of user experience design, and continue to grow grow grow grow. Thanks to all the folks at Google who spent countless hours answering questions and providing insights. Just know that you're not done yet.
