How would you explain such a phenomenon? Do you think that Feng Shui could really affect someone's life so drastically?

What would you do if you were in a similar situation? If everything in your life started going badly, would you seek advice from a fortune teller or Feng Shui practitioner?

When a series of bad things happen to you, do you think they are all coincidences, or do you believe that you are cursed with bad luck? What if you had a series of good things happen?
