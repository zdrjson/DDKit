History and Background
Originally, a state fair began as competition of livestock, and to show off different farm products which were not always for sale, Competitions among various fair-goers and participants in categories such as handicrafts, baked goods, jams and jellies, etc. have been a common practice for ages. Fairs have evolved to include carnival amusement rides and games (even some to test the strength of men!), music, and races. It' not uncommon for large fairs to host more than a million visitors over the course of a week or two. The first official state fair in the U.S was held in Detroit, Michigan back in 1849!

Demolition Derby
Americans go crazy for the events that happen at their local country fairs. One of the most exciting events in the demolition derby, a motorsport usually presented at country fairs and festivals. While rules vary from event to event, a typical demolition derby involves five or more drivers deliberately ramming their vehicles into one another. The last driver vehicle is still standing is declared the winner.
Does it sound like fun?

Bull Riding
Bull riding is another favorite attraction amongst fair-goers. In this event, a rider gets on a large bull and attempts to stay mounted for eight second. Of course, the bull jumps wildly, trying to buck off the rider.
The rider tightly fastens one hand to the bull with a long, braided rope. It is a risky sport and has been called "the most dangerous eight seconds in sports."
