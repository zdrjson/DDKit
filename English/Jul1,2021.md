Chicago is famous for its food, and is known as the home of many local specialties. It is a city of many neighborhoods, all of which have their own traditional cuisine.
Today we will discuss three of the most famous Chicago style foods: deep-dish pizza, the classic Chicago-style hot dog, and the Italian Beef.

Chicago-style Pizza
Chicago-style pizza refers to a style of pizza that was developed in Chicago, and is a treasured staple food that is immensely popular. The pizza is baked in a special round pan that resembles the type used for baking a cake, usually 3.1 centimeters deep. The pan is what gives the pizza its characteristically high crust and deep surface allowing for large amounts of topping, especially cheese.

Have you ever seen pictures of deep-dish pizza?
This is different than New York style pizza which is thin crust. Italian style pizza is very thin crust.
