The Wilderness
It's no secret that a huge portion of Alaska's landmass is made up of deserted wilderness. It's only deserted in terms of human inhabitants, though, as it's full of amazing fauna and flora. Be careful when losing yourself, as you might actually get lost and face fatal consequences, as many have.
What kind of fauna and flora are you used to seeing?

Questions
Do you own any sculptures?

Why do you think people face fatal consequences in the deserted wilderness?

People don't have the ability to escape the wildness. They can loose energy and their food, they can get scared.
