More Break-Ups
Psychology experts have also noticed that more and more marriages are breaking up. One of the reasons may be because Facebook makes it possible to communicate with old friends from high school or ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends that you have not had contact with in ages.

Less Real Communication
Also, couples are not communicating with each other as they should in real life. They sometimes even break up over Facebook and other social networks. Frequently, they do not argue about things in the usual way and tend to carry out quarrels in public. As a result, others comment about something that should be solved privately. They don't share their thoughts and feelings with each other, opting rather to share these thoughts and feelings with everyone else.
