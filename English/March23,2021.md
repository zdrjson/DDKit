Warm-Up

How often do you make phone calls in English?

Have you ever been misunderstood on the phone? What happened?

Have you ever had to cancel or change an arrangement? Explain what happened.

Useful Language
Making Arrangements
Could we meet on Tuesday at 11 a.m.?

How/what about September 13th?

Is 7 a.m. convenient for you?

Changing Arrangements

I'm afraid I can't make it on Friday. Are you available at another time?

I'm afraid something has come up. Could we reschedule?

I'm sorry, but I have to cancel our meeting.
