WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
One failure did not stop him. In 1923, he moved to Hollywood and started a new business, with his brother Roy, called Disney Brothers' Studio.
He then hired animators. They created  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the business was a success.
However, the company Universal Studios gained control of the Oswald trademark and took all of Disney's animators except for one.

ACHIEVEMENTS

In 1932, Disney decided he wanted to make a full-length animated film called Snow White.
People thought he was crazy for trying to make a cartoon that long. They called the film "Disney's Folly". However, Disney was sure the film would be a success.
The film took five years to complete and was finally released in 1937. It was a huge success, becoming the top film of 1938.
