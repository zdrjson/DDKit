Tips For Food Safety
 Store raw meat, poultry and seafood by wrapping them and placing them on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, to prevent raw juices from dripping on other food.
 Always marinate food in the refrigerator, not on the countertop. Throw away leftover marinades that have been used with raw meat.
 Replace/wash dish towels and sponges often to prevent the spread of bacteria. Use paper towels to dry washed hands after handling raw foods.
