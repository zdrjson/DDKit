in real time
Real time is an adjective that pertains to the relatively immediate response time of computers. It describes the normal passage of time from a human perspective, as opposed to how fast we expect a computer to process information before it makes it available for observation. For example, one chart shows rising and falling stock prices and updates every hour. Another graph is in real time, updating to show current prices every second or less.

I'm watching the weather online in real time. The blizzard is heading northwest.
