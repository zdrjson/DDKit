Luxor
The Luxor Hotel is named after a city in Egypt and was built in the shape of a pyramid. It is the second largest hotel in Las Vegas and the eighth largest in the world. It is one of the most recognizable casinos in Vegas because of its design, and because of the Luxor Sky Beam (the strongest beam of light in the world). The casino offers many attractions and five different live shows. The most popular live show is Criss Angel, a magician and illusionist, who once climbed the side of the hotel and reached the top of the pyramid.
