Healing Power of Sleep
Knowing that sleep has such a close tie to our brain, then it shouldn't come as a surprise that is also has profound effects on our body's ability to heal itself both physically and mentally. Physically, sleep helps the brain regulate our immune system and metabolism. Mentally, sleep is crucial to the balance of hormones inside our bodies.

Effect on Body
Studies have shown that being deprived of sleep for too long will decrease the total amount of white blood cells in the human body, which will make people more vulnerable to sickness. Another effect that sleep has over the human body is weight. When a person's sleep cycle is interrupted, so is one's metabolism level, causing a person's weight to fluctuate.
