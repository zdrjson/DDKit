Effect on Body
Studies have shown that being deprived of sleep for too long will decrease the total amount of white blood cells in the human body, which will make people more vulnerable to sickness. Another effect that sleep has over the human body is weight. When a person's sleep cycle is interrupted, so is one's metabolism level, causing a person's weight to fluctuate.

The Modern Marathon
Every year, more than 500 marathons are held in locations all over the world. The official distance for a marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195 km). Many of the participants are not serious competitive runners, but parents, workers, and even senior citizens who want the challenge of training for and completing the grueling distance. Potential marathoners must prepare for months before the event and often train ten or more hours each week.
