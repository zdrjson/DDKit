Your speed - This is one of the most common issues. Although most think that speaking fast means you are also thinking fast, if you have a very heavy accent, it's going to be very strenuous for your listeners, Therefore, please slow down, but not too slow.
Unable to finish your sentences - This can be because you are looking for the exact word to use, still haven't figured out how you should respond to a question in your response so that you not only give yourself extra time to think, but also show the other person that you were really listening to them.
