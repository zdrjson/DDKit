Colors
The colors used in an ad are probably the most important aspect of creating emotions in the people who view it and making it eye-catching. Colors are significant because they each represent different psychological feeling. For example, red is one of the most powerful colors. It symbolizes power, passion, energy, and urgency. It is extremely eye-catching but should be used with caution. Depending on the product, red might not be the wisest choice. For example, if the product is for something calm and relaxing, like a spa, then red would be inadvisable. Instead, using colors like blue or yellow would be preferred, since they create happy, peaceful, and calming emotions.
