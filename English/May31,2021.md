Establish Joint Goals
In order to manage household finances well, the family must first create shared financial goals after considering each member's different values, standards, and long-term or short-term needs. The goals shall be specific and measureable. For example, "to save a lot" would be a vague and unmanageable goal while "to ave 20 dollars for the kids" college and 40 dollars for retirement each day" is more specific and, therefore, can be easily managed on a daily basis. Also, bear in mind that the goal should be realistic, for example, "to save 90% of the income" would definitely be impossible for most people.
