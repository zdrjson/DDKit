Running a business is mostly unglamorous on a daily basis.

A lot of grinding and keeping the lights on.

Granted, there are some really powerful peaks of excitement, like launching new features, hearing success stories from customers, or reaching revenue milestones, but the grand majority of the time is filled with unwavering banality and grind.

4 years ago, a couple of days after I had gotten my "Hire" decision from Google, I messaged Antoine Pourchet and told him a combination of the following things:

- "Woah, compensation at these big tech companies is insane."

- "It's wild that these algorithm-style technical interviews can have such a life-changing impact on someone's life."

- "Preparing for these interviews was an atrocious experience. There's gotta be a better way to do it."

- "Wanna try starting a company around this? We could name it AlgoExpert, cause you know, algorithms and expert, and it could offer an all-encompassing online platform to prepare for technical interviews, with videos, an online IDE, code execution, multiple programming languages, etc..."

- "We each put down about a thousand dollars to boot up the business and got to work."

Just yesterday, AlgoExpert crossed 50,000 paying customers!

Software engineering, product development, and marketing : all equalling important aspects of building a successful tech business.

Don't be fooled into thinking one is less important than the other two.
