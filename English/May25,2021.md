Discussion
1. How would you define mobbing, harassment and bullying?
2. Have you ever been bullied? If so, tell the class about it.
3. Explain how a student can be a victim of bullying at school, or how an employee can be a victim of harassment or mobbing.

A student can be a victim because student wants to pick on them or for no reason. It can happen sometimes or all the time.

Meet Victoria
As Victoria's behavior continued to change, her workplace relationships continued to deteriorate and her colleagues blamed her and not her mental illness. Whenever she arrived at the office conversations would stop. She was no longer invited to attend meetings and no one talked to her at lunchtime. There was a lot of gossip about her being crazy.
