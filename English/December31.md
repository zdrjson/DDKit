Summer Without A Garden?
A garden is a place where you can relax after a day at work. With just a little imagination, any space around the house can be transformed into the perfect garden. You just have to prepare the suitable soil for the seeds you intend to plant and to get several indispensable tools: a trowel, a watering hose, a wheelbarrow, a roundhead shovel, a rake, shears, and a pitchfork. It's better to start with plants that grow easily. Most importantly: relaxÔºÅYou'll have achievements and failures, but the fun of gardening is to grow along with your plants.
