#1 in real time
Real time is an adjective that pertains to the relatively immediate response time of computers. It describes the normal passage of time form a human perspective, as opposed to how fast we expect a computer to process information before it makes it available for observation. For example, one chart shows rising and falling stock prices and updates every hour. Another graph is in real time, updating to show current prices every second or less.

I'm watching the weather online in real time. The blizzard is heading northwest.

#2 what is going on/down
This group of words replaces what's happening and can also be used as a full sentence. What's going on is a casual conversation starter that asks, "What are you doing?" without getting too personal. The phrase going down refers to a plan that is being executed and may involve deception or secrecy.

My phone isn't working so I don't know what's going on at the party.
I don't know what's going down at the party but I don't want to be there when it happens.

#3 withdrawal symptoms
If you ever tried to quit smoking, you felt the effects of withdrawal. Anything that is addictive will cause withdrawal symptoms if it is done habitually and then stopped. Symptoms may be stronger for some and not strong for others. One way to deal with withdrawal it to replace the undesirable habit with a desirable one.
