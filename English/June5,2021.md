Russia
This may be easier for some than others, but in Russia you should never mix, or even turn down, vodka. Adding anything to vodka, even ice, is considered polluting the drink. The only exception it to mix the vodka with beer, creating a drink they call "yorsh." Offering a person a drink is a sing of friendship and trust, so you should always accept, even if it's 8am.

Middle East
When drinking coffee with Bedouins in the Middle East, you should always shake your cup when you're finished. Otherwise, they will continue to pour you more coffee automatically. If you've had enough, make sure to shake the cup, which means tilting the cup a few times when you hand it back.
