TELLING YOUR FRIENDS
We all have had some kind of food that we absolutely love and want to recommend to our friends. Here are some things you might say to suggest a certain food or dish to someone:
Oh, you absolutely must try this! It is divine!
I highly recommend you try number three.
Might I suggest the blueberry flavor. Trust me, you won't regret it!

GROSS BUT NECESSARY FOOD EXPERIENCES
On the other hand, you may highly recommend that your friends try some kind of really gross food just so that they can say they've had the experience of trying it. Here are some ways to encourage people to try a disgusting dish:

This is soooo disgusting. You HAVE to try it just to see what I mean.
Have you had this? It's so gross. Here...

TESTING YOUR TASTES
Other times, you or your friends might want to try something just to see if you like it. Here are some things you might say in this situation:
Oh, I'd like to try just a little bit of that.
Just give me a little bite, please.
Here, just have a little taste and tell me what you think.
