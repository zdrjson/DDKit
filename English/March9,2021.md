STYLE AND SUBSTRANCE
Sometimes the wrapping is as important as the gift. Color, style and design can carry different meanings in different countries. For example, in Asia, both white and black are colors associated with funerals, while read means wealth and happiness.
Are there any colors that represent good or bad luck in your culture? Explain why they represent good or bad luck.

SUMBOLISM
Symbolism is very important in certain cultures. For example, clocks are not good gifts to give to your Chinese associates, no matter where they are. The word in Mandarin for clock is very similar to the word for death. Avoid fine linen handkerchiefs in Korea: handkerchiefs, even of the finest quality, are symbols of sadness. In all Asian cultures, avoid cutlery, as well, for they represent the cutting of a relationship.

Tell the class about some items from your culture that have negative symbolism and should not be give as gifts.
