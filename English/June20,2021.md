I can too critical of myself. A pattern I've noticed throughout my career is that I often feel I could have done more even if, objectively, I've done well. Earlier in my career, this led to burnout and negative self-talk. One solution I've implemented over the last three years is to actively pause and celebrate my achievements. Not only has this helped my own self-esteem, it has helped me genuinely appreciate and recognize my team and other support systems.

I never miss a deadline. I'm highly organized and I've applied my natural skill organizing people and projects to all aspects of my work. After seven years of working as a project manager, I've had only one late product launch. From that experience, which took place three years ago, I learned a crucial lesson about trade-offs. I spent time addressing a crucial design need and that pushed everything else back. I wouldn't trade the lessons I learned from that experience for anything being sure to communicate to stakeholders about upcoming roadblocks.
