   Bollywood's late movie mogul Yash Chopra, created classic love tales which made him the "King of Romance" in the India film industry. Chopra's early hits in the '70s helped establish Bollywood's biggest starts. Chopra's signature touches were romance, music and a European setting. His films of the 1980s. were shot in locales which were considered exotic for millions of Indians who could not travel abroad. Chopra often had the protagonists of his films galloping through tulip fields in the Netherlands or singing and dancing near Switzerland's idyllic lakes. He started his film career under the tutelage of his elder brother and the founded his own studio. His final film, As Long As I Am Alive, is scheduled for release across India soon.
