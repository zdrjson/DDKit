Introduction
Knowing your lexical chunks will help you to express yourself the same way native speakers do.

A lexicon is the entire stock of words in one language.
A chunk is a smaller piece of something bigger.

Lexical chunks are words that are always put together to form a phrase. We can learn how these phrases or "chunks" are used by making our own practice sentences.
