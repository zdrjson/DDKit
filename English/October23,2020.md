What is an Annual Meeting?
"Annual" comes from the Latin word meaning "year". Therefore, "annual" in English means once a year. When a corporation has an annual meeting it is a meeting that they have once a year. Some corporations have so many different branches around the world that they like to have an annual meeting to bring everyone together, including their shareholder. It is also a time for the corporation to show appreciation for all the hard work their employees have done and the shareholders who have invested in the company.

Does your company have annual meetings?

What is a Board Meeting?

The purpose of a board meeting is to have the directors of the company come together in order to make decisions for the company.

Who normally attends? Of course the President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. At times others will attend the meetings to participate or just to listen. Depending on how big the company is, the board meeting might be public so that almost anyone can attend as a bystander.

Have you ever attended a board meeting?

How to Have a Successful Board Meeting
Here are a few steps you can follow in order to have a successful board meeting.

Start early: Studies have found if you have a board meeting in the early morning (e.g. 8.00am or earlier), everyone will be refreshed from a good night's sleep. No one should be stressed from people throwing things at them because the business day has hardly started.

Get the easy problems out of the way.
Don't try to mislead the board members.
Let the CEO run the show.
Observe the 10/20/30 rule: Be happy to just cover ten points at the most in a meeting.
Don't surprise your board: If you have shocking news to share, tell each member before the meeting.

Pre-sell as much as you can: If you have a new idea you want to propose, try to talk to the other board members before the meeting to pre-sell them on the idea.
Present solution, not questions
Use them: Often board members do not utilize the board meeting fully, so don't be afraid to ask directly for what you need. If you have overstepped your boundaries, they will push back and you will know it. But most of the time this never comes even close to happening.

Some believe there are some magical words you should use at a board meeting. Believe it or not, there are, although many don't know that it's true. Here are some good phrases:
"We beat projections" - Everyone wants to know about what is good. Share as much as you can about what is going well.
"I don't know" - Admit when you don't know the answer or are not sure of how to solve a problem. Even if you are the CEO, you must be honest. The other board members will find out soon enough if you really don't know what you are talking about. Telling the truth can keep everyone on the same page.
"How do you think we should introduce the product?" - As mentioned in other classes, don't be afraid to ask those under you for ideas.

Things to Keep in Mind

Send out the material or agenda 48 hours before the meeting or earlier.
Some companies have found that having a dinner the night before to show appreciation for all the members can help the meeting go smoothly. It also gives them a chance to discuss some topics casually with the other board members.
The first 30 minutes of the meeting should be spent on the formal business and administrative stuff, this gives everyone time to calm down and get settled.

The CEO has the right to bring up his own questions and ideas in the meetings. He also has the right to direct the meeting. That is the privilege of being the CEO.

Annual Meetings
"AGM" is the abbreviation of "annual general meeting". Many governments in western countries insist on corporations having an annual meeting so the company (board members) can meet and associate with the public (other companies and shareholders). The actual meeting can be quite short, but surrounding the meeting there is normally a lot of entertainment and announcements for people who have received promotions. If there is a change among the board this will usually be announced then.

Agenda for an Annual Meeting
basic agenda might include:
Minutes from the last meeting
Appointment of a new Trustee( which might not need to be done at a meeting or could be done at a separate meeting)
The Annual Accounts
Any current or planned projects or current issues.
The only business news that most governments require at an AGM is:
The appointment of an auditor
Fixing the auditor's remuneration
Other business at an annual meeting usually includes:
Consideration of the financial statements
The election of directors
Countries like the United States, New Zealand, etc. require an annual meeting for corporations that are registered with the state or government.

Annual Meeting
There is normally some voting involved at annual meetings for new trustees and board members. You might wonder whether or not you are permitted to vote. It depends on the amount of shares you own within the company.
In western corporations, normally one share is worth one vote. But it depends on each corporation to decide the voting power.

Have you ever had the privilege of voting at an annual meeting?
