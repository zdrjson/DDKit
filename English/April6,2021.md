Changing Communication
Psychologists have started to define terms like Facebook addiction in their reports. Social media sites can be so addicting that people, especially youngsters, do not want to spend time doing anything else - they live their life in a virtual world. People often choose to talk to each other via mobile phones, Skype, or Facebook because they may be afraid of getting to know each other face-to-face. However, by doing this, they are missing out on their partner's facial expressions or the gestures that the other makes. Emotions are reduced to "likes" or "dislikes", smiley faces or other emoticons.
