Highway of Death - Iraq
It's no secret that many of Iraq's roads are dangerous these days. Given the ongoing wars and insurgencies, its roads are littered with improvised explosive devices (IEDs). One stretch of road, however, stands out from the rest. Highway 80, from Kuwait City of Basra, was given its nickname "Highway of Death" during the Persian Gulf War after American aircrafts bombed a retreating column of Iraqi tanks and trucks. 2,700 vehicles were destroyed in the attack. Death toll estimates range from 300 to 10,000.
