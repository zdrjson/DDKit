Bull Riding
Bull riding is another favorite attraction amongst fair-goers. In this event, a rider gets on a large bull and attempts to stay mounted for eight seconds. Of course, the bull jumps wildly, trying to buck off the rider.

The rider tightly fastens one hand to the bull with a long, braided rope. It is a risky sport and has been called "the most dangerous eight seconds in sports"

Find It Fried

There are two things you need to know about fair food: It's unhealthy and it's DELICIOUS! Everything seems to be bigger at the fair! Some fair staples include cotton candy, funnel cakes, French fries, corn dogs, sausage with onions and peppers and an array of deep-tried treats! These days, you can find deep fried pickles, onions, Oreos, Twinkies and even deep-fried ice cream!

The Rides
Do you enjoy the thrill of amusement park rides? If so, you'd most likely be a fan of the rides found at the fair. These heart-pounding rides are sure to get your adrenaline rushing! The Wild Claw, for example, is definitely not for the faint-hearted!

If you want to enjoy the scenery of the fair, in a more relaxing way, buy some ticketed and get in line for the Ferris wheel - and oldies but a goodie! A word to the wise: just make sure you haven't hoovered too much funnel cake before strapping in or you may be likely to toss your cookies!
