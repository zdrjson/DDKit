History and Background
Originally, a state fair began as competition of livestock, and to show off different farm products which were not always for sale. Competitions among various fair-goers and participants in categories such as handicrafts, baked goods, jams and jellies, etc. have been a common practice for ages. Fairs have evolved to include carnival amusement rides and gams (even some to test the strength of men!), music, and races. It's not uncommon for large fairs to host more than a million visitors over the course of a week or two. The first official state fair in the U.S was held in Detroit, Michigan back in 1849!

Demolition Derby
Americans go crazy for the events that happen at their local county fairs. One of the most exciting events is the demolition derby, a motorsport usually presented at county fairs and festivals. While rules vary from even to event, a typical demolition derby involves five or more drivers deliberately ramming their vehicles into one another. The last driver whose vehicle is still standing is declared the winner.

Does it sound like fun?
