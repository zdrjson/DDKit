Vocabulary Builder: Simple Ways To live Healthy

Introduction

Whether it's the media or just our associates, we're always hearing people talk about living a healthy lifestyle. But what exactly does that mean? Is living a healthy lifestyle as simple as not smoking, not being too overweight, eating well, and exercising? Or is there more to it? Today we'll be looking at some simple adjustments we can make to live life healthier.

Small Changes

People often think that in order to live healthy, they need to make drastic changes. However, the trick to living healthy is making small changes to our lifestyle. This can mean walking more when you can, adding fruit to your cereal, having an extra glass of water, and so on. That doesn't sound so intimidating, does it?

Activity

One of the biggest threats to our health is just lack of activity. People know it's good for them, but they avoid it at any cost. It's easy to get used to being sedentary, or to think exercise has to be vigorous to be effective. However, no matter what you do, movement is movement, and the more we do, the better. Day-to-day activities like doing chores, gardening , or just walking, can make a big difference if we do more of it. Let's look at some of the benefits of increased movement.

Benefits Of Increased Movement

Less risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes
Improved joints
Increased range of movement
Maintained flexibility with age 
Maintained bone mass
Prevention of osteoporosis and bone fracture
Improved mood
Reduced anxiety and depression
Improved self esteem
Improved memory in the elderly
Reduced stress

More Movement

Adding more activity will lead to losing at least some weight. If you don't think you can handle a structured disciplined program, just start small! Every little bit will help. Let's look at easy ways to start:

Turn the TV off. At least one day a week, leave the TV off. Instead, do something physical. Try playing games with your family, going for a walk, or pretty much anything more active then sitting on the couch.

Walk: Find ways to make yourself walk more each day. For example, when you go outside to get the mail, take s stroll around the block. If you have a dog, take him for an extra walk each day. Take a 5-minute walk on your treadmill before work.

More chores. Do some more gardening, rake the leaves, sweep your floors, vacuum, and more. These aren't vigorous exercises, but they keep your body moving, and you maintain your home in the process!

Pace while on the phone. Next time you're chatting on your phone, get up and walk around, or even do some light cleaning. This way you can do something you enjoy while keeping active.

Stay aware of your activities. List your typical daily activities. If you find you're sitting or most of your day, find ways to work in more movement. Take a short walk every hour, use the stairs at work, and so on.

Eat well

Eating healthy is also vital to a healthy lifestyle. Aside from better weight management, a healthy diet also improves your health and quality of life. There are countless online resources for determining how many calories you should consume and which food groups to focus on. There are also plenty of simpler ways to eat healthier. Let's consider some.

Simple Ways To Eat Healthier
Eat more fruit. You can work fruit into your cereal, salads, or pretty much any meal or snack.

Eat more vegetables. You can't go wrong with vegetables. Eat them as much as possible. This can be tomatoes in your sandwich, peppers on your pizza, or just more salads. Keep canned or precut vegetables around for a quick snack.

Change salad dressing. Make sure the salad dressing you're using is a low-fat version, which can greatly reduce your calorie intake.

Simple Ways To Eat Healthier
Low-fat or fat-free dairy products. A simple way to reduce calories without significantly changing what you eat is to switch to skim milk or fat-free yogurt.
Substitute. Look through your refrigerator or cabinets and see which three items you eat the most each day. Write down their nutritional contents. Next time you go grocery shopping, look for substitutes for those three times that have less calories.

Conclusion
Living a healthier lifestyle doesn't have to involve major life-changing adjustments. Drastic changes actually often end up in failure. Instead, try making these relatively minor changes to your day-to-day life and you'll see that they lead to some great rewards. Get started today!
