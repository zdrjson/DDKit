Another Superstitious Story
Simon was desperate for a girlfriend, and no matte how hard he tried to convince someone to date him, he was always rejected.

Simon decided that he must be possessed by an evil spirit that repelled all women, so he decided to seek help from an exorcist. The exorcist proceeded to chant and supposedly drew out the bad spirit. As a parting gift, he gave Simon a lucky charm to keep away other evil spirits.

The next day, Simon asked out the most beautiful girl in the office, and she agreed to go on a date with him.

Do you believe in lucky charms? What kinds of things can be used as lucky charms?
