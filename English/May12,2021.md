Ways to Manage a PR Disaster
Communicating directly with customers can diffuse a PR disaster. In 2009, a video was put online of Domino's Pizza staff doing something to a customer's pizza. You would not have wanted to eat that pizza.
Instead of using social media to ease the situation, the company stayed silent on the matter. The video ended up going viral, receiving more than a million views and further damaging Domino's Pizza's reputation.
