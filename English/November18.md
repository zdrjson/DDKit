MGM Grand
The MGM Grand is the largest hotel in the US, and the second largest in the world. It has 30 floors with 6,800 rooms. The property includes five outdoor pools, rivers, waterfalls, a 35,000 square meter convention center, the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and the Grand Spa. It also houses numerous shops and night clubs, 19 restaurants, and the largest casino in Las Vegas. One of the main attractions of the hotel was a lion habitat inside the casino, in which up to six lions were shown daily. Prior to its closure in 2012, the habitat allowed people to get up close to the lions via a see-through tunnel.

The Venetian
The resort opened on May 3, 1999, with a flutter of white doves, sounding trumpets and signers. Rising 145 meters high, and built at a cost of USD1.5 billion, it was one of the most expensive resorts of its kind when it opened. The Venetian is home to the second most profitable club is Las Vegas, the TAO nightclub. It is also home to the Blue Man Group, which is three performers who produce theatrical shows and concerts featuring experimental music (with an emphasis on percussion)
