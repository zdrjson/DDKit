Experience
One of our partners used to work in financial services for a bank. Another partner is a trained chef who has produced some amazing sandwich recipes. The chef has also created some unique fruit-juice cocktails and milk-based drinks after months of experimentation. 
Our team has youth and enthusiasm on its side. Our small juice bar and sandwich shop has already become very successful in the fashionable Covent Garden area of London.

Financial Commitment and Backing Required
We have put all our savings into the first sandwich bar. Friends and family have also invested a total of $120,000:
to rent and equip five juice and sandwich bars in commercial parts of London (3), Berlin(1) and Copenhagen (1),
to achieve economies of scale and bring down prices to the consumer, and 
to guarantee contracts with suppliers of organically-grown produce.
We require a further $800,000. Half this sum buys 20% share in the company. The remaining $400,000 will be paid back within four years.
