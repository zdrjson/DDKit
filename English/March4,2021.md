Retro Fashion

The word 'retro' is most commonly used when talking about fashion that is characteristic of times in the past; this includes garments, accessories, and even hairstyles. Nowadays, retro fashion is so common that you might be sporting a retro style without even knowing it! Love the tie-dyed look? That comes from the 70s. Can't go out with a headband? You can thank the 80s for that fashion tip.
For those that really love having an authentic retro look, vintage dresses and purses, especially from designers like Chanel and Dior if they can afford it, are always at the top of their wish-lists.

Garment - a piece of clothing.
