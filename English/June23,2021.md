Observe
Explain exactly what hours she will be expected to work, and check out what other commitments she has, Some au pairs do language classes or may even have part-time work schedules. Be aware that his may reduce flexibility in the event of a crisis or sudden change of schedule(if that's something you're prone to).
Introduce her to your children and see how they interact. It's probably overambitious to expect instant bonding, but she should at least attempt to communicate with them.

Be open and upfront
Try to explain as much as possible about your family - routine, likes and dislikes, mealtimes, television-viewing habits, usage of computers, leisure activities, family activities etc... Your potential employee will be able to judge whether they'll fit into your household.
Show it as it is. No last-minute rushing around with a vacuum, or attempts to create an ideal home ambience before the interview. A hyper-organized nanny might be traumatized to discover the horrible, chaotic truth.
Ask your prospective au pair or nanny her reasons for leaving her last job Changes in the family's circumstances are ok; evasive mutterings are not.
