The reckoning of American police entered a new chapter this week with the televised spectacle of federal security agents overrun by a mob of armed far-right extremists storming the Capitol.

On its face, the siege was a failure of planning: The U.S Capitol Police, who deal with all sorts of protests and demonstrations year round, did not seem to anticipate the threat posted by thousands of people who, at the urging of President Donald Trump - and after sharing their plans online - converged on the Capitol to protest his election loss. Although some officers fought with them - one rioter was shot to death and one officer later died of injuries - others took selfies and appeared to offer no resistance, allowing dozens of rioters to leave without being arrested.

The relatively lenient handling of the invaders was deeply troubling to many Americans whose views of Wednesday's mayhem were influenced by their reaction to the anti-police protests that roiled the country over the summer. The attack on the Capitol may end up deepening the divisions between those who want police power diminished and those who warn of lawlessness, underscoring the need for police to repair their relationships with their communities.
