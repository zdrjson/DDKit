It's About Being Together

Mealtime is all about being together as a family hand helping children feel loved, safe, and secure. Focus your attention on enjoying each other's company, rather than on what or how much your children are eating. This is also a great time to teach your children about some family values and traditions.

Try keeping the conversation light-hearted and positive. This will help encourage your children to talk about their days and develop better communication between family members. If there is a need for a difficult or disciplinary conversation, schedule it for some time other than during meals.


Positive Role Models

Parents are often their kids' role models, making it vital that parents display good table manners and a willingness to try new foods. Simply put, kids are much more likely to eat the same foods as their parents and practice the same table manners. A good way to ensure your child doesn't become a picky eater is to make offering them new foods a regular mealtime routine.

Of course they won't like everything you offer them, so teach them to politely refuse things they don't want to try. This is also a great opportunity to remind your children to eat slowly, chew their food well with their mouth closed, and to enjoy their meal. Keep in mind that children often take much longer to eat than adults - so don't rush them!
