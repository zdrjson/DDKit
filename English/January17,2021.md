A Superstitious Story...

Serena decided that her new place had bad Fend Shui because her lift had been fine before she moved there. So, she visited a famous Feng Shui practitioner to see what she could do to change her Feng Shui. He told her how to reorganize her furniture so that all the bad luck would go away.

Serena did as she was told. Mysteriously the next day, after she had rearranged her furniture , the tenant next door moved out. When Serena got to work that day, she was promoted back to her supervisor position. And, when she was on her lunch break, she got a phone call from her insurance company saying they would cover the expenses from her car accident.

As you can guess, Serena has been extremely superstitious ever since.
