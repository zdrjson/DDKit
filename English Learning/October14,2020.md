Introduction

Knowing your lexical chunks will help you to express yourself the same way native speakers do.

What is a lexical chunk?

A lexicon is the entire stock of words in one language.
A chunk is a smaller piece of something bigger.

Lexical chunks are words that are always put together to form a phrase. We can learn how these phrases or "chunks" are used by making our own practice sentences.

#1 in real time

Real time is an adjective that pertains to the relatively immediate response time of computers. It describes the normal passage of time from a human perspective, as opposed to how fast we expect a computer to process information before it makes it available for observation. For example, one chart shows rising and falling stock prices and updates every hour. Another graph is in real time, updating to show current prices every second or less.

I'm watching the weather online in real time. The blizzard is heading northwest.

# 2 what is going on/down

This group of words replaces what's happening and can also be used as a full sentence. What's going on is a casual conversation starter that asks, "What are you doing?" without getting too personal. The phrase going down refers to a plan that is being executed and involve deception or secrecy.

My phone isn't working so I don't know what's going on at the party.
I don't know what's going down at the party but I don't want to be there when it happens.

# 3 withdrawal symptoms

If you ever tried to quit smoking, you felt the effects of withdrawal. Anything that is addictive will cause withdrawal symptoms if it is done habitually and then stopped. Symptoms may be stronger for some and not strong for others. One way to deal with withdrawal is to replace the undesirable habit with a desirable one.

He experienced withdrawal symptoms when he stopped drinking coffee but his stomach thanked him for it.

# 4 beg the question

Originally, this term describes a logical fallacy in which a statement or claim is assumed to be true without evidence other than the statement or claim itself. For example, the statement "Natural foods are good for you because they are from nature," begs the question. But linguists are losing the fight on this phrase. Journalist and other media people are using it to mean bring up the question.

Her decision to post her relationship problems online begs the question of whether it is possible to share too much.
