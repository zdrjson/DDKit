So you're a software engineer and you want to get promoted? Here's how:

1) Be very familiar with the promotion criteria for the level or role that you're eyeing. You don't want to be doing work that's completely tangential to promotion.

2) Consistently perform at the next level. You can be the best L4 engineer out there, but if you're not performing at L5 level, you won't be promoted to L5--you'll just a fantastic L4.

3) Actively seek out opportunities for career progression. Waiting for these opportunities to fall on your lap isn't enough.

4) When next-level work opportunities *do* fall on your lap, seize them. Failing to do so is the easiest way to *not* get promoted.

5) Make sure that your manager and peers have visibility into your work. As annoying or political as it might feel, ensuring that others around you are aware of the work that you're doing and recognize its worth is critical.

6) Triple-down on your strengths, all the while keeping your weaknesses in check. This is how you stand out.

7) Needless to say, work hard for it. Getting promoted isn't easy, and it certainly won't just magically happen.
